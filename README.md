# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this project was to improve PlanMyTrip app by retrieving more information so the users can choose the best option for the vacation. In this module we prompt the user with a minimum and maximum temperature for the city they would like to travel to. After having this information we run the code to get the cities from our dataset that would match ehat the user was looking for. As we provide the cities, we will also provide the name of a hotel as well as the weather description in this cities.

After the user has reviwed the different cities, they would choose 4 cities to create a travel itinerary. After they choose those 4 cities, we will create a travel route that they can follow.
